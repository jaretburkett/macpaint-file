A MacPaint file format translator. Convert MacPaint PNTG files to PNG.

Originally from https://github.com/thejoelpatrol/macpaint-file . I added some functionality to make it easier to convery bulk images/

Put all the images you want to convert in `./input`. It does not scan subfolders, so they need to be in the root folder

Run this command

`python do_folders.py` 

All the images it can convers will be converted.
